This repository contains my completedproject, focusing on improving a bank's failure prediction model and computing the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
Key components of the assignment include:
Model Improvement: Enhanced the existing failure prediction model by adding two new features, providing an intuitive explanation for their inclusion, and performing univariate comparisons.
Model Evaluation: Fitted a logistic regression model with the new features and calculated the AUC for the model. Compared classification metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision) for different thresholds to recommend an optimal threshold.
Dow Jones Calculation: Computed the Dow Jones Industrial Average as of the latest available data and adjusted the index divisor following a hypothetical reconstitution.
The project includes the Jupyter Notebook with code and outputs (L02_Failure_prob.ipynb), relevant data files (Market_Riskfree_2312.csv, CPI.csv), and a detailed PDF report outlining the methodology and findings (Assignment 1.pdf).
